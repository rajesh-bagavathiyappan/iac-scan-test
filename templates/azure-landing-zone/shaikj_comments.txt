1. In module-naming-convention , if we give special characters like '-' or '_' in environment_short_name & landing_Zone_short_name, terraform should be  smart enough to remove it from name for below resources. 
	    In storage account name only lower letter and number should be allowed 
	    In Keyvault name should only contain  letter, number & '-'. 
	    In recovery_services_vault name should only contain  letter, number & '-'. 
	    In api_management  name should only contain  letter, number & '-'. 
	    In sql_server  name should only contain  letter, number & '-'. 
	    Also add random string of 4 characters (letters or numbers) for all above resource name at the end. 

2. In module-subnet , NSG rule outbound 443 rule is not needed, and since u r using the same subnet to apim also add 3443 inbound port. Default rule should look like below. 
	  default = [
	    {
	      name                       = "inboundrule443",
	      priority                   = 100,
	      direction                  = "Inbound",
	      access                     = "Allow",
	      source_port_range          = "*",
	      destination_port_range     = 443,
	      source_address_prefix      = "*",
	      destination_address_prefix = "*"
	    },
	    {
	      name                       = "Inboundrule3443",
	      priority                   = 101,
	      direction                  = "Inbound",
	      access                     = "Allow",
	      source_port_range          = "*",
	      destination_port_range     = 443,
	      source_address_prefix      = "*",
	      destination_address_prefix = "*"
	    }
	  ]
	}
	
3.  In module-monitor resource "azurerm_network_watcher_flow_log" "flowlog" needs name defined. 

4. for module-vnet  resource "azurerm_network_ddos_protection_plan" "ddos" is not needed. remove it.. it's cost very high.. 

5.  for module-sql-db set default varibles to set SQL db size. 
    edition                          = "Standard"
    requested_service_objective_name =  "S3"

6.  Also add .ignorelist and exclude .terraform  and  .terraform.lock.hcl files from repo. 

Below are comments on Policies. 

For Azure policy allowedlocations, the location are hardcoded not parameterized. What if we want to allowed location to be west Europe etc .

Also for allowed location policy, I see if it is not allowed location it would just audit, isn't it supposed to deny Resource deploymentâ€¦? .

For az policy namingconvention the name pattern is hard coded not parameterized, what if we want to have different name.

for few azure policies I see metadata category is demo, when we rollout, we don't want it to be categorized as demo. Also it's hardcoded, we want to modify it if or when needed.
